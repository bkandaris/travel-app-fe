### `Why did I build this project?`

Using third party API's is fun! Companies like [mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/) provide great documentation to build something cool with! Using the Mapbox API a developer can display a map easily as well as receive data to be used for an application. This was good practice handling data on the frontend and backend, using global state, and handling CRUD requests.

### `What did I learn?`

I learned how to use the mapbox API to display a map the `timeago.js` package to display a date stored in MongoDB to be more readable for the user. Using `react-bootstrap-icons` I was able to make the app's logo as well as the pins for the user's reviews on the map.
